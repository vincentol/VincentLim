				<td> Neuschwanstein Castle </td>
				<td> Neuschwanstein castle is a nineteenth-century Romansque Revival palace in 
				southwest Bavaria Germany. It is one of the most popular turist destinations
				in Europe, partly due to how it reminds visitors of fairytales. I want to visit
				this location because I love European architecture and would love to see the little
				details that went into the building.</td>

				<td> Museum Island </td>
				<td> Museum Island, located in Berlin, Germany, is an ensemble of five museums.
				This makes it the go-to museum for art and history lovers. I love museums so I
				would love to be able to visit 5 at the same time!</td>

				<td> Lorelei </td>
				<td> Lorelei is a large rock on the Rhine river. It stands 194-metre-high and 
				is shrouded in legend. This popular tourist attraction is not only aesthetically
				appealing, but also a great place to learn about old stories in the German
				culture. And these stories are something I would love to here! </td>

				<td> The Monument to the Battle of the Nations </td>
				<td> The Monument to the Battle of the Nations in Leipzig Germany is dedicated
				to the 1813 Battle of Leipzig. Enriched in German history, this would be a great
				place for tourists to dive into German history that many do not know about. And
				if there is something I love, it's knowing things that others don't! </td>
